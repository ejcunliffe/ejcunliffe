## Hi there! âœ¨

I landed here from a culmination of events:
- I have always wanted to work in a space I'm extremely passionate about. 
- Q1 2020: I officially completed a MS degree in a technologically focused discipline (informatics) because I wanted to explore the future of data.
- Q3 2020: I worked really hard on initiatives beyond my scope of work and conversations with executive team to take my next career step.
- Q1 2021: I officially started my new role working on the first ever North America Process Standardization (optimization) team!
- Q1 2022 to Q1 2025: While learning the ins-and-outs of this new role, I got married and had "two kids under two" while working full time.
- Q2 2025: Ready to hit the ground running with the mentality that I won't live in fear of failure.
- I'm at the perfect spot on my journey/path now to direct focus on professional things that excite me!
- I've had a variety of conversations that indirectly landed me here, on GitHub.

I'm always exploring, planting seeds, wanting to collaborate, and constantly curious so PLEASE bother me and teach me something new.
