## I'm An ✨ Interesting ✨ One

I don't feel like I belong here yet, but I landed here from a variety of reasons:
- I have always wanted to work in a space I'm passionate about. 
- I took a brief "passion" hiatus while I got married and had my "two girls under two years old" (it was a busy 3 years). This gave me a refreshed mindset on what it looks like to go after what I want.
- I'm at the perfect spot on my journey/path now to direct focus on professional things that excite me!
- I've had a variety of conversations that indirectly landed me here, on GitHub.

I'm always exploring, planting seeds, wanting to collaborate, and constantly curious so PLEASE bother me and teach me something new.
