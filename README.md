## Hi there! âœ¨

I landed here from a culmination of events:
- I have always wanted to work in a space I'm extremely passionate about. First, I built skills that will help me across industries, organizations, and job responsibilities.
- Q1 2020: I officially completed a MS degree in a technologically focused discipline (informatics) because I wanted to explore the future of data.
- Q1 to Q3 2020: I worked really hard on initiatives beyond my scope of work and conversations with executive team to take my next career step.
- Q1 2021: I officially started my new role working on the first ever North America Process Standardization (optimization) Team! The youngest on the team. Time to learn. 
- Q1 2022 to Q1 2025: While learning the ins-and-outs of this new role, I got married and had "two kids under two". Company restructure.
- Q1 2025: Obtained PMP Certification!
- Q2 2025: Ready to hit the ground running with the mentality that I won't live in fear of failure. UPSKILL. UPSKILL. CONNECT. UPSKILL.
- I'm at the perfect spot on my journey/path now to direct focus on professional things that excite me!
- Thankful for the variety of conversations and upskilling topics that indirectly landed me here, on GitHub.

I'm always exploring, planting seeds, wanting to collaborate, and constantly curious so PLEASE bother me and teach me something new. 

Time to PLAY.
