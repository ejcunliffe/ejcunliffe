## Hi there! âœ¨

I landed here from a variety of reasons:
- I have always wanted to work in a space I'm passionate about. 
- I took a brief "passion" hiatus 2022-2025 during which I got married and had "two kids under two". This gave me a refreshed mindset on what it means to go after what I want, which is: don't live in the fear of failure.
- I'm at the perfect spot on my journey/path now to direct focus on professional things that excite me!
- I've had a variety of conversations that indirectly landed me here, on GitHub.

I'm always exploring, planting seeds, wanting to collaborate, and constantly curious so PLEASE bother me and teach me something new.
